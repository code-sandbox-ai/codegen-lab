1. **Identify the issue** - What's happening vs what's expected
2. **Root cause** - Explain why this is occurring
3. **Step-by-step breakdown** - Walk through the execution flow
4. **Solution** - How to fix it
5. **Prevention** - How to avoid this in the future
6. **Related patterns** - Similar issues to watch for

## Response Format

### Issue Analysis
