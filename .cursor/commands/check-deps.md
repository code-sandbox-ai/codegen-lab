For all dependencies in the build.gradle.kts file, check if we are using the latest version.

Use public APIs - each library is available under a public URL

For gradle plugins
```bash
https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/{PLUGIN_NAME}
```

For dependencies
```bash
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/{PACKAGE_NAME}
```
